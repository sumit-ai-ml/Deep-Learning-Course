🌟 **Welcome to Our Deep Learning Journey!** 🚀

Hello and a warm welcome to our exciting course on Deep Learning! Unlike traditional courses that often separate theory from practice, we aim to blend these two crucial elements seamlessly. By adopting a "learn by doing" philosophy, we'll dive into the practical applications of concepts as we explore them.

### 📘 Course Structure
Our journey will unfold over seven comprehensive lessons, each featuring a hands-on coding exercise within the class. To facilitate our learning, we'll primarily use Jupyter Notebooks in the Google Colab environment.
