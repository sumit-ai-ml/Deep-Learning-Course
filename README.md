Hi ðŸ˜ƒ welcome to the course ðŸ‘».
In this course, we will study the basics of Deep Learning. Generally, in other courses, the rule is first theory and then practical. In this course, I will try to cover both parts simultaneously. We will follow the learning by doing approach and in final lecture we will build a simple Machine Learning web app using **Gradio** as seen below.

This course is divided into the 5 lessons: Every course will have one in-class coding assignment.  

## 1. Introduction of Deep Learning and Python Programming:

In this lecture we will use Kaggle Environment Please click here: [![Open Lesson 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-20BEFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Kaggle&logoColor=white)](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- Basic Python operations and funtions. [![Open Lesson 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-20BEFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Kaggle&logoColor=white)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sumpandey/basic-python-operations/notebook)
- Perceptron (Father of Artificial Neural Network or single Neuron): Theory and practical. [![Open Lesson 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-20BEFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Kaggle&logoColor=white)]()

    ðŸ“Œ &nbsp;<b><u>EDA summary:</u></b><br>
    
* <i> There are 248 patients in the dataset.</i><br>
* <i> There are 1,113 visit_id, which means each patient visited around 4.48 times on average. This means, on average, each patient has 4~5 records.</i><br>
* <i> There are often several peptides per protein. You should merge peptides dataset to protien.</i><br>
* <i> There are 227 unique UniProt ID, while there are 968 types of peptide. </i><br>
