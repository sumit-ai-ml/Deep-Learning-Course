# Introduction to Practical Artificial Intelligence for High School Students

## Course Duration
3 Months (approximately 12 weeks)

## Course Description
This course introduces high school students to the fundamentals of practical artificial intelligence (AI) with a focus on hands-on projects and real-world applications. Students will learn the basics of AI, machine learning, and deep learning, and apply their knowledge to solve real-world problems.

- Control flow (if statements, loops)

### Week 2: Data Manipulation and Visualization
- Data handling with Python (NumPy and Pandas)
- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

### Week 3: Introduction to Machine Learning
- What is machine learning?
- Supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- Linear regression (Weather Prediction)

### Week 4 and 5: Classification and Clustering
- Classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- Clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means)
- Practical applications (e.g., image classification)

### Week 6: Deep Learning and Neural Networks
- Introduction to neural networks
- Building a simple neural network from scratch
- Using PyTorch for deep learning
