Hi ðŸ˜ƒ welcome to the course ðŸ‘».
In this course, we will study the basics of Deep Learning. Generally, in other courses, the rule is first theory and then practical. In this course, I will try to cover both parts simultaneously. We will follow the learning by doing approach.

This course is divided into the 5 lessons: Every course will have one in-class coding assignment.  

1. **Introduction of Deep Learning and Python Programming** 

- Introduction to the IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Anaconda, **Google Colab** and Kaggle Environment. [![Open Lesson 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-20BEFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Kaggle&logoColor=white)]()
- Basic Python operations and funtions. [![Open Lesson 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-20BEFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Kaggle&logoColor=white)]()
- Perceptron (Father of Artificial Neural Network or single Neuron): Theory and practical. [![Open Lesson 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kaggle-20BEFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Kaggle&logoColor=white)]()
