Hi ðŸ˜ƒ welcome to the course ðŸ‘».
In this course, we will study the basics of Deep Learning. Generally, in other courses, the rule is first theory and then practical. In this course, I will try to cover both parts simultaneously. We will follow the learning by doing approach and in final lecture we will build a simple Machine Learning web app using Gradio.
